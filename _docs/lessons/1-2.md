## Active Learning
- Take a look at [racing-turtles.py](../lessons/code/racing-turtles.py) and make sure that you understand it fully.
- Modify the program so that a third racing turtle starts at coordinate (-200, -100).
- How could the original program be improved?
- Time permitting, make other enhancements to the program.
