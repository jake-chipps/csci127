## Python Reading
Read about `onclick()`, `onrelease()` and `ondrag()` in the [turtle module documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html#module-turtle).

## Key Ideas
- `onscreenclick()`
- `onkey()`
- `onclick()`
- `onrelease()`
- `ondrag()`

## Active Learning
- Take a look at [turtle-onkey-events.py](../lessons/code/turtle_onkey_events.py) and make sure you understand it fully. Use the [turtle documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) to see how to write the event functions for the turtle module.
  - For example, why does the `up()` function have no arguments but the `clickleft(x,y)` function takes two?
- Take a look at [etch-a-sketch.py](../lessons/code/etch-a-sketch_practice.py) and make sure that you understand it fully.
  - How could this program be improved?
  - Enhance the program in one or more ways.
