## Python Reading
- Read the chapter entitled [Python Modules](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/PythonModules/toctree.html).

## Key Ideas
- Be able to use the math module to solve problems.
- Be able to use the turtle module to solve problems.
- Be able to use the random module to solve problems.
- Be able to figure out how to use other modules when needed.

## Active Learning
- Take a look at [key-events.py](../lessons/code/key-events.py) and make sure that you understand it fully.
- Add appropriate comments to key-events.py.
- Modify the program so that pressing the **f** or **F** moves the turtle forward 50 pixels in its current direction.
- Modify the program so that pressing the **r** or the **R** turns the turtle 45 degrees to the right but does not move the turtle.
- Time permitting, make other enhancements to the program.
