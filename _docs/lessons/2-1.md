## Python Reading
- Read the chapter entitled [Functions](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Functions/functions.html).

## Key Ideas
- Be able to write a function.
- Be able to call a function.
- Understand function parameters.
- Understand the difference between a fruitful function and a non-fruitful function.
- Understand the difference between a local variable and a global variable.

## Active Learning
- Look at [randomIntegers.py](../lessons/code/randomIntegers.py) and [circles.py](../lessons/code/circles.py), and be able to say what each line does.
- Complete the [missing function](../lessons/code/evaluate.py) such that the following output might be produced when the program is run.
```
Course Evaluation Program
-------------------------
Enter course to evaluate (e.g. CSCI 127): CSCI 127
Enter your topic interest rating [0-100]: 100
Enter your difficulty estimation rating [0-100]: 45
Enter your instructor assessment rating [0-100]: 95
CSCI 127 rating:  80.0
Highly recommended!
```

## More Practice
- Work [Exercise 10](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Functions/Exercises.html).
- Improve [house.py](../lessons/code/house.py) by rewriting it using appropriate functions.
