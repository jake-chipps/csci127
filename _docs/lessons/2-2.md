## Python Reading
- Read the chapter entitled [Selection](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Selection/toctree.html).

## Key Ideas
- The bool type has values `True` and `False`
- Boolean operators: = =, !=, >, >=, <, <=
- Logical operators: and, or, not
- Conditional statements: if, if else, if elif else
- Conditional statements can be nested
- Writing and calling Boolean functions

## Active Learning
- Consider a simplified game of UNO that has forty different cards. Each card has a color ("red", "yellow", "green" or "blue") and a value (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9). Complete the boolean function below so that it returns True if the second card can be played on the first card and False otherwise.
`def legal_play(first_value, first_color, second_value, second_color):`
  - For example, `legal_play(3, "blue", 3, "green")` and `legal_play(5, "yellow", 7, "yellow")` should both return `True`, but `legal_play(9, "red", 6, "green")` should return `False`.
- Take [key-events.py](../lessons/code/key-events.py) and modify it so that the turtle only moves if it will still be visible. Use one boolean function in your solution.
