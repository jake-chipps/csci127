## Python Reading
- Read the chapter entitled [Recursion](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/IntroRecursion/toctree.html).

## Key Ideas
- A recursive algorithm must have one or more situations where the answer can be immediately calculated. These are the **base cases**.
- A recursive algorithm must have one or more situations where the algorithm calls itself, either directly or indirectly, with a problem that is easier to solve. These are the **general cases**.

## Active Learning
- Experiment with [convert.py](../lessons/code/convert.py) until you fully understand it.
- What is the base case?
- What is the general case?
- Verify that the answers produced for the three test cases are correct.
- Explain why `print(convert(100, 1))` produces an error.
- Explain why `print(convert(100, 200))` produces an error.
- What is the largest base for which the convert function is correct?
- Uncomment the three statements and supply the missing unconvert function. The function should be recursive and take two parameters. The first parameter is a string representation of a number and the second parameter is the base of the first parameter. The function should calculate and return the base 10 integer equivalent of the first parameter.
