## Python Reading
- Read the chapter entitled [Lists](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Lists/toctree.html) from section "Lists" through section "Cloning Lists".

## Key Ideas
- A **list** is an ordered collection of items that can be of any type, e.g. ["Joy and Beauty of Data", 2023].
- List creation
  - `row_1 = ["Jerico", "Riley", "Anna", "Jessica"]`
  - `row_2 = ["Leah", "Nick", "Amber", "Cory"]`
  - `rows = [row_1, row_2]`
- Determining List Length: len
- Accessing List Elements
  - `row_1[1]`
  - `rows[1][2]`
- List Membership: in and not in
- List Concatenation: +
- List Repetition: *
- List Slices
  - `row_1[2:4]`
  - `row_1[:2]`
  - `row_1[2:]`
- Lists are mutable (unlike Strings)
  - Replacement: `row_1[0] = "Morgan"`
  - Deletion: `row_1[1:3] = []`
  - Deletion: `del(row_1[0])`
  - Insertion: `row_2[2:2] = ["Logan", "Daniel", "Dyllan"]`
- List Aliasing: `row_1 = row_2`
- List Cloning: `row_1 = row_2[:]`
