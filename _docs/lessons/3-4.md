## Python Reading
- Read the chapter entitled [Files](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Files/toctree.html) from section "Working with Data Files" through section "Iterating over Lines in a File".

## Key Ideas
- Opening a File
  - To read from it: `open(filename, "r")`
  - To write to it: `open(filename, "w")`
  - To close it: `filevariable.close()`
- Absolute File Paths vs. Relative File Paths
- The file [census.txt](../lessons/code/census.txt) captures this 2013 census data.
- The file [census.py](../lessons/code/census.py) reads and prints the census.txt file.

## Active Learning
- Solve the **Binarize It** problem on this [programming contest problem set](../lessons/code/ucfcontest.pdf). Read the input from a file named *binarize.in* and send the output to the Python shell.
- Modify census.py so that it calculates and prints the total 2013 U.S. population. (If your program is correct, the number will match the number on the web page above.)
