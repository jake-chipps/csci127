## Python Reading
- Read the chapter entitled [Files](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Files/toctree.html) from section "Alternative File Reading Methods" through section "Writing Text Files".

## Key Ideas
- File Reading Methods
  - `filevar.readline()` - in conjunction with a while loop to read an entire file
  - `filevar.readlines()`
- File Writing Methods
  - `filevar.write(some_string)`
- Experiment with [census-2.py](../lessons/code/census-2.py) and [census.txt](../lessons/code/census.txt) until you fully understand census-2.py

## Active Learning
- Work [Exercise 5](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Files/Exercises.html) without looking at the answer.
