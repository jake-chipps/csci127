## Key Ideas
- A **csv** (comma-separated values) file is a common file format.
- The file [grades.csv](../lessons/code/grades.csv) is an example of a csv file that might be used to keep track of grades in The Joy and Beauty of Data.
- Creating a new file from an existing file is a common task for a computer scientist.

## Active Learning
- Write a Python program that creates a file named **grades2.csv**. The new file should contain all of the information from **grades.csv**. In addition, there should be a fourth column entitled **Average**. For each student, the value in the new column should be the average of the two grades.
  - *Solution*: [grades_with_average_column.py](../lessons/code/grades_with_average_column.py)
