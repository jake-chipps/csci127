## Python Reading
- Read the chapter entitled [Dictionaries](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Dictionaries/toctree.html) from section "Dictionaries" through section "Dictionary Operations"

## Key Ideas
- A **dictionary** is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
- Creating an empty dictionary: `homeruns = {}`
- Adding a key-value pair: `homeruns["Babe Ruth"] = 713` (note: he hit 714)
- Adding another pair: `homeruns["Mickey Mantle"] = 536`
- Deleting an item: `del homeruns["Mickey Mantle"]`
- Modifying an item: `homeruns["Babe Ruth"] = 714`
- Determining the number of items in a dictionary: `len(homeruns)`

## In-Class Activity
- Download and experiment with [raven.py](../lessons/code/raven.py) and [raven.txt](../lessons/code/raven.txt) until you understand how raven.py works.

## Active Learning
- Modify raven.py to count and print the occurrences of each letter in the alphabet from 'a' to 'z', regardless of whether it is lowercase or uppercase. Use a dictionary in your solution.
