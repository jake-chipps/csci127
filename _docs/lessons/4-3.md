## Python Reading
- Read the chapter entitled [Dictionaries](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Dictionaries/toctree.html) from section "Dictionary Methods" through section "Aliasing and Copying"

## Key Ideas
- Keys
  - To retrieve all keys in a dictionary named inventory: `inventory.keys()`
  - To retrieve all keys as a list: `list(inventory.keys())`
  - To retrieve keys one at a time: `for key in inventory:`
  - To check if a key named "kiwi" exists: `if "kiwi" in inventory:`
- Values
  - To retrieve all values: `inventory.values()`
  - To retrieve a specific value, producing a runtime error if the key is not present: `inventory[key-name]`
  - To retrieve a specific value, producing NO runtime error if the key is not present: `inventory.get(key-name)` or `inventory.get(key-name, value-to-return-if-key-not-present)`
- Key-Value Pairs
  - To retrieve all key-value pairs: `inventory.items()`
- Aliasing vs. Copying
  - An example of an alias: `dictionary1 = dictionary2`
  - The expression `dictionary2 is dictionary1` returns `True`
  - An example of a copy: `dictionary2 = dictionary1.copy()`
  - The expression `dictionary2 is dictionary1` returns `False`

## Active Learning
- Work [Exercise 2](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Dictionaries/Exercises.html).
- Work [Exercise 5](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Dictionaries/Exercises.html) without looking at the answer. Feel free to add additional words to translate!
