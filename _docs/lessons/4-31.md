## Python Reading
- Read the chapter entitled [Dictionaries](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Dictionaries/toctree.html) from section "Sparse Matrices" through section "Glossary"

## Key Ideas
- A dictionary handles **sparse** data well. For example, consider keeping track of how many times a word occurs in a novel such as *The Catcher in the Rye*. Only words that appear one or more times need to be stored.

## In-Class Activity
- Download and experiment with [sparse.py](../lessons/code/sparse.py) until you understand how it works.

## Active Learning
Modify sparse.py so that function `most_frequent` works.
