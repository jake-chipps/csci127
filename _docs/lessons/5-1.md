## Python Reading
- Read the chapter entitled [Classes and Objects - the Basics](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/ClassesBasics/toctree.html) from section "Improving Our Constructor" through section "Adding Other Methods to Our Class"

## Key Ideas
- Today's reading provides additional examples and explanations of concepts that were introduced previously.

## Active Learning
- In the game of *BlackJack*, an ace is worth 11 points, a king is worth 10 points, a queen is worth 10 points, a jack is worth 10 points, and all other cards are worth face value.
- Download [card.py](../lessons/code/card.py) and [blackjack.py](../lessons/code/blackjack.py) onto your local machine. Complete method `assign_value` and function `process_hand` such that the following output is produced when the program is run.
```
ace of spades, king of diamonds evaluates to 21

queen of hearts, ace of spades evaluates to 21

ace of spades, jack of clubs evaluates to 21

ten of spades, ace of spades evaluates to 21

two of spades, three of clubs, four of diamonds, five of hearts, six of spades, seven of clubs evaluates to 27

eight of diamonds, nine of hearts, two of spades evaluates to 19
