## Python Reading
- Read the chapter entitled [Classes and Objects - the Basics](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/ClassesBasics/toctree.html) from section "Objects as Arguments and Parameters" through section "Glossary"

## Key Ideas
- Functions can take objects as parameters.
- Functions can return objects.
- Method `__str__` can be used to override how objects are printed, e.g. `print(object)`.

## In-Class Activity
- Take a look at [carddeck.py](../lessons/code/carddeck.py) and make sure you fully understand it.

## Active Learning
- Uncomment the two commented statements at the bottom of carddeck.py and supply the missing `shuffle` method.
- Split the solution into three files: Card.py, Deck.py and carddeck.py.
