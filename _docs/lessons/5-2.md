## Python Reading
- Read the chapter entitled [Inheritance](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/Inheritance/toctree.html) from section "Pillars of Inheritance" to section "Extending".

## Key Ideas
- Terminology: One class can inherit the state variables and methods from another class. This is known as **inheritance**.
- For example, the class **Student** is a subclass of **Person**. For example, the class **Teacher** is a subclass of **Person**.

## In-Class Activity
- The program [dungeons.py](../lessons/code/dungeons.py) illustrates the concept of inheritance in the context of Dungeons and Dragons. Make sure you fully understand this example.
- Draw a picture of the inheritance hierarchy.

## Active Learning
- Modify the Dungeons and Dragons program to enable another character type (such as an elf or a dwarf) to be created. Test your program to make sure that it works properly.
- Add appropriate comments to the program. Ask someone to check that you have done so in an appropriate manner.
- Make an additional interesting enhancement to the program.
