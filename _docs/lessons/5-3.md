## Python Reading
- Read the chapter entitled [Classes and Objects - Digging Deeper](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/ClassesDiggingDeeper/toctree.html) from section "Fractions" to section "Objects are Mutable".

## Key Ideas
- A **fraction** can be implemented as a class. A fraction consists of two integers: a **numerator** and a **denominator**.
- An **instance** of a class is **mutable**.
- A **mutator method** is a method of a class that changes the values of one or more **instance variables**.

## In-Class Activity
- Take a look at [fraction.py](../lessons/code/fraction.py).
- In the Fraction class, identify the **instance variables**.
- In the Fraction class, identify the **constructor**.
- For each method in the Fraction class, identify whether or not it is a **mutator** method.
- Trace what happens when the `simplify` method is called when the numerator value is 36 and the denominator value is 48.
- Explain why the `add` method is correct.

## Active Learning
- Make sure you fully understand the fraction.py file. Ask questions as necessary.
- Add a `multiply` method to the program and test that it works properly. Ask someone to check your solution.
