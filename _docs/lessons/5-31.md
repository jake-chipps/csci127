## Python Reading
- Read the chapter entitled [Classes and Objects - Digging Deeper](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/ClassesDiggingDeeper/toctree.html) from section "Sameness" to section "Arithmetic Methods"

## Key Ideas
- **Shallow Equality** occurs when two variables refer to the same object in the computer's memory. The python keyword `is` tests for shallow equality.
- **Deep Equality** occurs when either there is shallow equality OR two variables refer to objects that contain the same underlying (significant) values.
- The method `__add__(self, other)` can be defined so that the operator + can be used.

## In-Class Activity
- Consider [dungeons.py](../lessons/code/dungeons.py).
- Draw a picture that demonstrates shallow equality of two Humans.
- Modify the program above to demonstrate your understanding of shallow equality using the Python keyword `is`.
- Draw a picture that demonstrates deep equality of two Humans.

## Active Learning
- Modify the program above to add a function that illustrates your understanding of deep equality.
- Modify fraction.py to use method __add__(self, other_fraction) instead of method `add(self, other_fraction)`.
