## Python Reading
- Read the introduction entitled [What is NumPy?](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/whatisnumpy.html)

## Key Ideas
- NumPy is Python library written in C to provide fast numerical methods for scientific computation.
- NumPy enables Python users to use a data structure called an array. You can conceptualize an array as an efficient implementation of a list.
- The most common arrays are 1-D (one dimensional) or 2-D (two dimensional) arrays. However, Python arrays can contain any number of dimensions.

## Getting Started
- Install NumPy on your machine:
  - Windows: `python -m pip install numpy`
  - Mac: `pip3 install --user numpy`

## In-Class Activity
- One way to gain insight into numeric data is to calculate its mean and standard deviation. [More information](https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/standard-deviation.html).
- Sometimes it is useful to sort numeric data into either ascending or descending order. Why?
- Download [numpydemo.py](../lessons/code/numpydemo.py) and conduct experiments until you fully understand it.
- Can you explain how the sort function works?
- The sort function does not return anything. Why does the shoulder_heights array in the main program change?
- Can you modify the sort function so that it sorts the data into descending order?
- The NumPy module includes a sort function. Can you find the relevant documentation and then use it?
- What are other useful things you might want to do with a 1-D array?

## Active Learning
- Work through [tutorial1.py](../lessons/code/tutorial1.py).
