## Python Reading
- Read the [NumPy Quickstart Tutorial](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html)

## Key Ideas
- Array Slicing

## In-Class Activity
- Create a one-dimensional array called **v** with 10 integers. Each integer should be a random number between 1 and 100.
- Create a new array which consists of the odd indices of previously created array **v**.
- Create a new array in backwards ordering from **v**.
- What will be the output of the following code:

```
a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
b = a[1:4]
b[0] = 200
print(a[1])
```

- Create a two-dimensional array called **m** with 25 integers in a 5 by 5 matrix. Each integer should be a random number between 1 and 100.
- Create a new array from **m**, in which the elements of each row are in reverse order.
- Create another array from **m**, where the rows are in reverse order.
- Create another array from **m**, where columns and rows are in reverse order.
- Create another array from **m**, where the first and last row and the first and last column are cut off.
