## Python Reading
- Read this overview of [Numerical & Scientific Computing with Python](https://python-course.eu/numerical-programming/) page
- Browse [NumPy Basics](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.html)

## Key Ideas
- Creating np arrays
- Slicing and reshaping arrays
- Operations on arrays such as **broadcasting**

## In-Class Activity
- Introduce Program 5.
- Understand [broadcast.py](../lessons/code/broadcast.py), a program that illustrates the concept of **broadcasting**.

## Active Learning
- Create a **Person** class that contains two fields: a first name and a last name. Then create a numpy array that contains 5 Person(s). Finally, use the built-in **sorted** function to alphabetize the array using the last name as the primary key and the first name as the secondary key.
