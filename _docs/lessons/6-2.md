## Python Reading
- Read Lesson 1 from [Learn Pandas Lessons](https://bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas/src/master/).

## Key Ideas
- The **pandas** library supports data analysis, data manipulation and data visualization.
- The name derives from "panel data", a term for multidimensional structured data sets.

## Getting Started
- Mac: `pip3 install --user pandas`
- Windows: `python -m pip install pandas`

## Lecture Activity
- Understand [lesson1.py](../lessons/code/lesson1.py) completely.

## Active Learning
Modify the lecture code as follows.
- Plot the largest snowfall by year.
- Make **Bridger Bowl** the title of the chart.
- The lecture code draws a bar chart. Draw at least two other types of graphs with the data.
