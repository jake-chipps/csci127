## Python Reading
- Read Lesson 2 from [Learn Pandas Lessons](https://bitbucket.org/hrojas/learn-pandas/src/master/).

## Key Ideas
A data scientist must sometimes:
- Create Data (if it doesn't already exist)
- Access Data (that has already been created)
- Manipulate or **Munge** Data (that has already been input)
- Analyze Data (that has already been munged)
- Present Data (to help people understand it)

## Lecture Activity
- Understand [lesson2.py](../lessons/code/lesson2.py) completely.

## Active Learning
- Modify the lecture code to generate 10 random scores that range from 30 to 100 for each student.
