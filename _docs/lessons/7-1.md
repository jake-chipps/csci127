## Python Reading
- Read this [MatPlotLib tutorial](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/users/pyplot_tutorial.html) through the section called *Working with text*.

## Getting Started
- Install matplotlib on your machine:
  - Windows: `python -m pip install matplotlib`
  - Mac: `pip3 install --user matplotlib`

## Lecture Activity
- Understand [graphs.py](../lessons/code/graphs.py)

## In-Class Activity
- Modify graphs.py to label the x-axis as x and the y-axis as y.
- Modify graphs.py to plot the straight lines with magenta dashes. [Hint](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/api/pyplot_api.html).
- Modify graphs.py to draw the sine wave with 5 point size.
- Modify graphs.py by replacing `plt.xlim` and `plt.ylim` (in the main function) with an equivalent `plt.axis` statement.

## Active Learning
- Reproduce [this graph](../lessons/code/scores.png) as closely as possible.
- Assumption: There are 10 students whose student IDs are 1 through 10.
- Assumption: Practicum scores can range from 0 to 100 and are generated randomly.
- Assumption: You are student 5. The label **me** appears below each of your scores.
