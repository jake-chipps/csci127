## Key Ideas
- The information to be visualized can come from an input file.

## Lecture Activity
- The file [montana.txt](../lessons/code/montana.txt) contains census data from [this source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montana#Demographics).
- The program [montana.py](../lessons/code/montana.py) displays this data. Make sure you fully understand how this program works.

## Active Learning
- Modify the program above so that it shows the net population increase (or decrease) from one census date to the next in a second figure. (The first figure should continue to show the original graph.)
- Time permitting, add a third figure that displays the data in some other interesting manner.
