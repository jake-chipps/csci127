## Logistics
**Due**: Friday, May 19th no later than 11:58 p.m.

**Partner Information**: Complete this assignment individually.

**Submission Instructions**: Upload your solution, entitled **YourFirstName-YourLastName-Lab1.py** to the BrightSpace **Lab 1** Dropbox.

**Deadline Reminder**: Once this deadline passes, BrightSpace will no longer accept your Python submission and you will no longer be able to earn credit. Thus, if you are not able to fully complete the assignment, submit whatever you have before the deadline so that partial credit can be earned.

## Learning Outcomes
- Meet your lab teaching assistant and classmates.
- Be able to modify a simple Python program.
- Be able to use Montana State's Course Management System, BrightSpace, to submit an assignment.
- Be able to modify your BrightSpace profile to include a recognizable photo or sketch.

## Assignment
At the start of the lab period, everyone will provide a one-minute introduction. You can talk about whatever you like but if you aren't sure what to talk about consider stating your name, your year in school, your major, why you chose that major, your favorite hobby and a fun factoid. This will help everyone get to know possible future programming partners or study partners.

Download [etch-a-sketch.py](../lessons/code/etch-a-sketch.py) and rename it according to the instructions above.
Modify the code so that whenever the color is changed, both the pencil and the entire square (where you click to change colors) change to the same new color. Hint: you only need to make changes to the drawing_controls function.

## Grading - 10 points
0 points - If you are having trouble installing Python, bring your laptop to lab so that we can help you.

2 points - You attend lab and introduce yourself.

3 points - BrightSpace contains a recognizable photo or sketch no later than 11:58 p.m. on Friday, May 19th. (Partial credit: 1 point for replacing the BrightSpace default photo with anything, 2 points for showing multiple people without it being clear who is you.)

2 points - A Python program named **YourFirstName-YourLastName-Lab1.py** is submitted to the BrightSpace **Lab 1** Dropbox no later than 11:58 p.m. on Friday, May 19th.

3 points - The Python program is correct.

## Grading Turnaround
All in-labs and programming assignments should be graded with scores recorded in BrightSpace no later than your lab time on the following Tuesday.
