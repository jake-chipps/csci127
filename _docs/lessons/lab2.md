## Logistics
**Due**: Tuesday, May 23rd no later than 11:58 p.m.

**Partner Information**: Complete this assignment individually.

**Submission Instructions**: Upload your solution, renamed to **YourFirstName-YourLastName-Lab2.py** to the BrightSpace **Lab 2** Dropbox.

**Deadline Reminder**: Once this deadline passes, BrightSpace will no longer accept your Python submission and you will no longer be able to earn credit. Thus, if you are not able to fully complete the assignment, submit whatever you have before the deadline so that partial credit can be earned.

## Learning Outcomes**
- Gain experience writing a Python function.
- Gain experience writing Python selection statements.

## Assignment
Download [lab2.py](../lessons/code/lab2.py) and rename it according to the instructions above.

Modify the program by adding the missing function. The missing function will use Python selection statements to calculate the amount of tax that a single (unmarried) taxpayer owes using the table below. If the missing function is implemented correctly, this output will appear.

[2022 Federal Tax Bracket](https://taxfoundation.org/2022-tax-brackets/)

Note: the federal tax is progressive. For example, if a person has a taxable income of $15,000, the first $9,700 is taxed at a rate of 10% and the remaining $5,300 is taxed at a rate of 12%.

| Rate | For Unmarried Individuals, Taxable Income Over | 
| --- | --- |
| 10% |	$0 |
| 12% | $10,275 |
| 22% | $41,775 |
| 24% | $89,075 |
| 32% | $170,050 |
| 35% | $215,950 |
| 37% | $539,900 |

## Grading - 10 points
7 points - Your program calculates the income tax for each of the seven test cases correctly (1 point each).

3 points - A function with the correct name (1 point), correct parameters (1 point) and correct return value (1 point) is used in the solution.

## If Time Remains
If you want to work with a partner on Program 1 (due May 29th), use this time to identify a partner or ask your lab TA to help you find someone. Note: For the vast majority of computing jobs and internships, the ability to work with one or more teammates is a crucial skill!
