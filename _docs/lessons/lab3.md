## Logistics
**Due**: Thursday, May 25th no later than 11:58 p.m.

**Partner Information**: Complete this assignment individually.

**Submission Instructions**: Upload your solution, renamed to **YourFirstName-YourLastName-Lab3.py** to the BrightSpace **Lab 3** Dropbox.

**Deadline Reminder**: Once this deadline passes, BrightSpace will no longer accept your Python submission and you will no longer be able to earn credit. Thus, if you are not able to fully complete the assignment, submit whatever you have before the deadline so that partial credit can be earned.

## Learning Outcomes
- Gain experience manipulating strings.
- Gain experience solving a problem using iteration.
- Gain experience solving a problem using recursion.

## Assignment
Download [lab3.py](../lessons/code/lab3.py)

Rewrite the body of the `count_built_in` function to calculate and return the number of vowels in the parameter sentence using the built-in count method. For example, if the sentence is *I like Jazz music.*, the function should return `6`.

Rewrite the body of the `count_iterative` function to count the number of vowels in sentence using a loop. (Do not use the built-in count method.)

Rewrite the body of the `count_recursive` function to count the number of vowels in sentence using recursion. (Do not use the built-in count method.)

## Grading - 10 points
3 points - The count_built_in function is implemented correctly.

3 points - The count_iterative function is implemented correctly.

4 points - The base case (2 points) and two general cases (1 point each) of the count_recursive function are implemented correctly.
