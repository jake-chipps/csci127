## Logistics
**Due**: Saturday, May 27th no later than 11:58 p.m.

**Partner Information**: Complete this assignment individually.

**Submission Instructions**: Upload your solution, renamed to **YourFirstName-YourLastName-Lab4.py** to the BrightSpace **Lab 4** Dropbox.

**Deadline Reminder**: Once this deadline passes, BrightSpace will no longer accept your Python submission and you will no longer be able to earn credit. Thus, if you are not able to fully complete the assignment, submit whatever you have before the deadline so that partial credit can be earned.

## Learning Outcomes
- Gain experience manipulating lists.
- Continue gaining experience using functions, iteration and boolean expressions.

## Background
In a soccer match, a win is worth 3 points, a tie is worth 1 point, and a loss is worth 0 points. Due to poor record-keeping, the MSU KickCats know how many games they played each season, as well as the total points they earned for each season. The team has hired you to write a program that recreates the possible combinations of wins, ties and losses for each season.

## Assignment
Download [lab4.py](../lessons/code/lab4.py)

Replace the pass construct in each function with the necessary Python code to produce [this output](../lessons/code/lab4_output.txt).

## Assumption
There will always be at least one legal combination of wins, ties and losses.

## Grading - 10 points
2 points - The output format is matched exactly.

8 points - Your program will be graded using a different value for `soccer_seasons`. For each season that produces the correct output, you will earn 1 point.

## Test Data
`soccer_seasons = [[2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 6], [17, 17], [17, 24], [0, 0], [10, 2], [10, 3]]`

## If Time Remains
Work on Program 2, seeking feedback as necessary.

In preparation for next week's practicum, review any course concepts that are unclear, seeking feedback from your lab assistant(s) if desired.
