## Learning Outcome
- Gain experience with object oriented programming.

## Assignment
A smart phone has the ability to save contact information. In this assignment, you will simulate the contact list for a very simple smart phone.

Download [lab8.py](../lessons/code/lab8.py), rename it according to the instructions above, and make sure you understand it.

Take the program above and modify it by adding the missing Contact class such that when the program is run, it produces [this output](../lessons/code/lab8_output.txt).

## Grading - 10 points
2 points - The constructor of the Contact class is correct.

2 points - The reader methods of the Contact class are correct.

2 points - The writer methods of the Contact class are correct.

2 points - The `print_entry` method of the Contact class is correct.

2 points - Your program's output matches the output format of the transcript above (1 point for each type of difference up to 2 points).
