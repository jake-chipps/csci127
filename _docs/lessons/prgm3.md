## Logistics
**Due Date**: Wednesday, June 7th no later than 11:58 p.m.

**Partner Information**: You must complete this assignment with exactly one partner who is enrolled in the class.

**Submission Instructions**: Upload your solution, entitled **YourFirstName-YourLastName-PartnerFirstName-PartnerLastName-Program3.py** to the BrightSpace **Program 3** Dropbox. Note: Only one partner should submit the solution. If both partners submit a solution, the submission that will be graded is the one from the partner whose last name comes alphabetically first.

**Deadline Reminder**: Once the submission deadline passes, BrightSpace will no longer accept your Python submission and you will no longer be able to earn credit. Thus, if you are not able to fully complete the assignment, submit whatever you have before the deadline so that partial credit can be earned.

## Learning Outcomes
- To gain experience working with a partner. The ability to work effectively with other people is a valuable skill to develop.
- To gain experience extracting information from a dataset.
- To gain experience with Python files.

## Background Information
The input file for this assignment is the **video_games.csv** file, located on [this page](https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/video_games/). You may assume that this file is located in the same directory as your python program.

## Assignment
Write a first function, one that is no longer than 20 lines of Python, that extracts and displays interesting information from the video games file.

Write a second function, one that is longer than 20 lines of Python, that extracts and displays interesting information from the video games file. The function should do something significantly different than the first function.

Write a third function, one that is longer than 20 lines of Python, that extracts and displays interesting information from the video games file. The function should do something significantly different than the first and second functions.

## Advice
Before writing any Python code, fully understand the video game dataset.

Before writing any Python code, brainstorm with your partner to identify three insightful pieces of information that can be extracted from the dataset.

Work with your partner to develop the solution, test it and make improvements to it.

Make sure each partner fully understands the solution.

## Grading - 100 points
Note: Working with a partner is required. If you do not submit a solution with a partner, you will not earn any points.

10 points. The first function is well-written and no longer than 20 lines. (2 points for each type of improvement possible.)

15 points. The first function extracts interesting information (12 points) and displays it clearly (3 points).

10 points. The second function is well-written and longer than 20 lines. (2 points for each type of improvement possible.)

15 points. The second function extracts interesting information (7 points) that is different than the first function (5 points) and displays it clearly (3 points).

10 points. The third function is well-written and longer than 20 lines. (2 points for each type of improvement possible.)

15 points. The third function extracts interesting information (7 points) that is different than the other two functions (5 points) and displays it clearly (3 points).

10 points. The program is commented correctly. (2 points for each type of improvement.)

15 points. The overall solution is organized well and is of high quality. (3 points for each type of improvement.)
