## Logistics
**Due Date**: Thursday, June 15th no later than 11:58 p.m.

**Partner Information**: You may complete this assignment individually or with exactly one partner. If you work with a partner, you and your partner must be enrolled in the same lab section. (Otherwise, you and your partner will receive no credit.)

**Submission Instructions (working alone)**: Upload your solution, entitled **YourFirstName-YourLastName-Program4.py** to the BrightSpace **Program 4** Dropbox.

**Submission Instructions (working with one lab mate)**: Upload your solution, renamed to **YourFirstName-YourLastName-PartnerFirstName-PartnerLastName-Program4.py** to the BrightSpace **Program 4** Dropbox. Note: If you work with a partner, only one person needs to submit a solution. If you both submit a solution, the submission that will be graded is the one from the partner whose last name comes alphabetically first.

**Deadline Reminder**: Once the submission deadline passes, BrightSpace will no longer accept your Python submission and you will no longer be able to earn credit. Thus, if you are not able to fully complete the assignment, submit whatever you have before the deadline so that partial credit can be earned.

## Learning Outcomes
To solve this problem, you need to understand the following Python concepts: object-oriented programming and lists.

## Background Information
The file [pokedex.txt](../lessons/code/pokedex.txt) contains partial information about 31 Pokémon that mostly come from this [Pokédex](https://pokemondb.net/pokedex/all).

## Assignment
Using [pokedex.py](../lessons/code/pokedex.py) as a starting point, supply the missing functions such that interaction with a user could produce [this transcript](../lessons/code/pokedex_transcript.txt).

## Grading - 100 points
20 points. The class Pokemon is defined (2 points) with the appropriate six methods (3 points each).

5 points. The function `print_menu` is correct.

10 points. The function `print_pokedex` is correct.

10 points. The function `lookup_by_name` is correct when the Pokémon is present (7 points) and absent (3 points).

10 points. The function `lookup_by_number` is correct when the number is present (7 points) and absent (3 points).

10 points. The function `total_by_type` is correct when the type is present (7 points) and absent (3 points).

10 points. The function `average_hit_points` is correct.

10 points. The format of the output matches the format of the output in the transcript exactly. (2 points for each type of difference up to 10 points.)

15 points - The Python solution is properly commented, easy to understand and does not contain unnecessary code. (3 points for each type of improvement up to 15 points.)
