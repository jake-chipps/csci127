**First Practicum**: Wednesday, May 31st

**Time**: 50 minutes

**Location**: Barnard Hall 126

The exam will emphasize the Python materials that we have covered to date. To reinforce your understanding, it might be helpful to review the labs, programming assignments, lecture material, interactive textbook and active learning exercises.

The Python topics we have covered include data types, turtle graphics, modules, functions, selection statements, iterative statements, strings, recursion, lists and files.

You may bring one 8.5 inch by 11 inch sheet of double-sided notes.

You may use a computer to develop your answers. You may only use the internet to access the interactive python textbook, the online python documentation or previous python programs that you (or you and your partner) wrote for this course.

To be successful on the exam, strive to **understand** the Python material and be able to use it to solve small problems.
