## Summer 2023
*Note: dates and assignments more than a week out may be adjusted as the semester goes on. Please consider this page to be a living document subject to changes througout the semester. *

### [Schedule of classes and due dates](../home)

## Class
Instructor: Dr. Jake Chipps

Class takes place on Monday through Thursday from 2:00 - 4:20 pm in Barnard Hall Room 126 -- first floor behind the "Apple Bar". It's recommended you bring your laptop to follow along with in-class coding examples. 

The main text we will use for this course free and [online](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html). 

## Labs
LAB assignments should take you roughly 1-2 hours to complete, and are designed to ensure that you understand the syntax and computational required to successfully demonstrate understanding of the current content.

The lab portion of the class is embedded into the 6-week, 4-day schedule (see [schedule](../home)). Lab time is designed as a chance to work on the LAB assignments with the support of peers as well as myself.

## Programming Assignments
PROGRAMS are take-home assignments that are meant to take a bit more effort than the LABs. Subsequently there are fewer of them, and you will have more time to finish. It is strongly recommended you make every effort to finish the programs before the deadline, as early as possible. A tip: zeros are a lot worse than a plain old bad grade. If you get your program together enough that you think it would be worth some points, go ahead and submit it early in D2L -- you can always improve it and resubmit right up until the deadline.

## Exams
There are three exams (called *Practicum*) over the course of the semester, including the final exam during finals week. The exams take place in the Barnard classroom during regular class hours (except for the final exam, which has its own [schedule](https://www.montana.edu/registrar/exam_schedule.html) at the end of the semester.) These exams are all weighted evenly -- the final exam is not worth any more points than the other two.

## Grading
*Note: Practicums must be taken at the regularly scheduled time at the designated place and will not be given early or late.*

- Weekly Labs: 40% (evenly weighted)
- Programs: 30% (evenly weighted)
- Practicums: 30 % (evenly weighted)

Grades will be determined (after any curving takes place) based on your class average as follows:
- 93+: A
- 90+: A-
- 87+: B+
- 83+: B
- 80+: B-
- 77+: C+
- 73+: C
- 70+: C-
- 67+: D+
- 63: D
- 60: D-
