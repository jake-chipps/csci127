              <p class="lead">Provides a gentle introduction to the exciting 
                world of big data and data science. Students expand their ability 
                to solve problems with Python by learning to deploy lists, files, 
                dictionaries and object-oriented programming. Data science libraries 
                are introduced that enable data to be manipulated and displayed. 
                To succeed in this course, either basic computer literacy or CSCI 
                107 is recommended.</p>
